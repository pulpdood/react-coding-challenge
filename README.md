React Coding Challenge for Stan. - Kevin Yip

## Requirements

-   NodeJS
-   Yarn

## Getting Started

After cloning, run Yarn to install dependencies:

    yarn

or:

    npm install

## Running Application

After installing dependencies, run the command:

    yarn start

or:

    npm start

## Technical and architectural design rationale

-

## What I would do differently if I had more time and improvements that could've been made:

-   Use TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript for type safety
-   Use CSS modules and have single CSS file for each of the components
-   I would have made smaller commits or branches
-   Add a Layout.js file which wraps around the content and includes the header and footer and content in the middle
-   Maybe putting the port and url of the backend into environment variables
-   Added query parameters to the backend to allow for custom feed options, e.g. total number of results
-   Using a hand-written filter function for better performance
